  <div class="home-box home-box1 home-font box-2"><span class="content-span">I was born and raised in Dhaka, Rayer Bazar. My fascination with new technologies began at an early age. It was hard for me not to get hooked on technologies like touch screen phones, IPS batteries, electronic toy cars, and what not! My passion for science fascinated me and I wondered how far we could stretch ourselves as humans. This is how I decided to major in Computer Science. We are limitless, aren't we? These things are still a mystery to me...
